# Jarzynski-M

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the **Modified Jarzynski Estimator**, a powerful method for calculating **free energy differences** from 
non-equilibrium molecular simulations. Please see our publication: "A modified Jarzynski Free-Energy Estimator to Eliminate Non-conservative Forces and Its 
Application in Nanoparticle-membrane Interactions" https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/cp/d1cp05218g.
